# Antman

The goal is to compress and decompress data files while maintaining the original file's content. The antman program will take a file and a number as input, and it will output the compressed version of the file. The giantman program will take a compressed file and its type as input, and it will output the original version of the file. The type of compression to be used is lossless compression, and there are two different file types to deal with: text files and P3 PPM images. The output from the giantman program should be exactly the same as the original file given to the antman program.

Use "./antman/antman -h" and "./giantman/giantman -h" for further information.
